Rob Sable, creator of some of the most popular plugins, created another with rss\_plugin\_installer. This plugin allows a TXP admin to easily maintain plugins by Rob.

I'm currently envisioning a Txp Plugin Universe, where plugin developers release RSS feeds to their plugins and a TXP admin can manage plugins from their admin interface.
