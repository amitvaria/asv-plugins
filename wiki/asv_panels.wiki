#summary Documentation for asv_panels

= Overview =

asv_panels widgetizes the creation of articles in Textpattern by allowing you to fully customize the layout of the article creation page.


= Install =

After installing asv_panels in your Textpattern environment, you must run the install command from the help file of the plugin. This will setup the appropriate tables and prefs needed to use asv_panels.

= Uninstall = 

Before uninstalling asv_panels, I recommend running the uninstall command from the help file. This will permanently remove any changes asv_panels brought to the Textpattern database.

= Usage =

asv_panels comes with a default panel that you can use to learn how to setup and use asv_panels. The panel is designed to mimic the usability of the current write page. This panel is located under "Content->Default".

= Customization =

You can now visit "Extensions->Panels" to begin customizing and creating panels. 

= Extensibility = 

asv_panels is based off widgets which can be customized, but was written with the idea of extensibility in mind. Developers can create additional widgets to extend the use of the panel. For example, I've included some new widgets like the "image chooser", which lets the writer see a list of all the images from the Textpattern install. These images can then be added to the main body field.
