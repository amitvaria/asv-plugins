#summary Control content and users.

= Introduction =

Currently, TextPattern contain 5 hardcoded roles that allow users certain backend functionality, depending on their role. Unfortunately, this presents an issue when attempting to create controlled content on the front end. asv_community will resolve this using a mixture the current users table and a new table to hold 'members'. 

= What is a member? =
A member is visitor of your site that has a unique login that is granted permission to view specific content. A member can be explicitly granted access to view content, or can be associated to a group that has been granted access to the article.

= What is a group? =
A group is a collection of users.

= Uninstalling =
Any article that requires permission to be viewed, will be marked as hidden. Therefore, should the plugin ever be uninstalled or disabled, the content will remain protected.

= Tables =
In order to grant members permissions, the following new tables are required:
asv_community_members
{
 id
 name
 email
 username
 password
}
asv_community_groups
{
 id
 name
}
asv_community_group_members
{
 id
 member_id
 group_id 
}
asv_community_article_permissions
{
 id
 article_id
 type (member, group)
 type_id
}
asv_community_category_permissions
{
 id
 category_name
 
}


= Current Issues =
As it stands right now, all TXP users can see all generated content through the backend. Without modifying the TXP core, there is no way to limit the visibility to them.
